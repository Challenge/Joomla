Joomla
======
**This repository contains the files needed for Joomla (like components) which are not located directly on the homepage.**

To package all the Joomla components into zip files (so they can be uploaded and installed in Joomla) run `make` from the root directory.
The script requires the normal linux base system and also relies on the program 'zip' to package the files into zip-format.
