Joomla
======
This repository contains the files need for joomla (like components) which are not directly located on the homepage.

To package all the Joomla components into zip files (so they can be installed in Joomla) run ./build_joomla-component.sh from the root directory.
The script requires the normal linux base system and also relies on the program 'zip' to package the files into zip-format.
To install this program refer to the installation guide for your linux distribution.
